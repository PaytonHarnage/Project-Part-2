# Project-Part-2 - Port-Protocol Quiz

Port-Protocol Quiz is a Python-based quiz application that helps users learn and test their knowledge of common networking protocols and port numbers. This tool supports two quiz modes, allowing users to either guess the protocol associated with a given port number or identify the port number for a specified protocol.

# About
This project is designed as a learning tool for networking students or professionals to familiarize themselves with port numbers and protocols. The quiz offers an engaging way to reinforce knowledge of common networking ports, supporting:

Protocol by Port Mode: Identify the protocol based on a port number.
Port by Protocol Mode: Identify the port number associated with a given protocol.

# Getting Started
